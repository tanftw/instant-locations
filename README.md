Imagine you have to enter information for shops, hotels, or companies... you’d probably need various fields: address, state, suburb, post code, latitude, longitude… Each time you add or edit them, you must enter and check all these fields manually. It's such a nightmare if you have hundreds or thoudsands posts because it’s slow, time-consuming and sometimes, inaccurate. You'll need a better way to work with it. All data should auto populate immediately without setup location database.

Instant Locations interacts with Google Maps API and automatically populates location data into your fields. Now you only have to type the desired address, verify it by the auto-suggested addresses from Google Maps API and then select the correct one from dropdown. All other fields’ values (post code, street, state, country, …) will be automatically filled in instantly.
